## Introduction

Merriam-Webster Lookup for NVDA provides immediate, distraction-free access to the full Merriam-Webster website experience directly within NVDA. Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Slang content is presented in a clean, structured format optimized specifically for screen reader users. Non-essential and visually cluttered sections commonly found on the website are removed to ensure a focused and efficient reading experience.

This add-on intentionally uses the full Merriam-Webster website rather than the limited API. The website provides richer editorial content, more complete examples, dedicated Synonyms sections, structured word history, and additional educational material that are not fully available through the API. Wordplay and Grammar & Usage articles and categories are also supported, and they are not available through the API.

The quickest way to open the add-on is the default gesture:  
**Control+Alt+Shift+D**

You can invoke the add-on from anywhere to instantly look up the word under the cursor or any currently selected word or phrase.

Full audio pronunciation playback is supported directly inside NVDA without opening a web browser.
